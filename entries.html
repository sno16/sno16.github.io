<h3>Entry #1:</h3>
<hr />
<pre>Im relativly unexperienced in the website world.
I really do not know anything other than HTML and
Lua. If you are observing the site now, you can see
there is little-to-none CSS. I don't like CSS. Now,
most people like a webpage that has vibrant colors
and animated pages made with Adobe Spark. Well,
guess what. Im not that type of person. I am using
an HTML editor not even knowing if this will work
or not. I belive the beauty of a website comes from
the content, not the images and animated videos 
and animations, etc. Now, if you do have a problem
with that, then please kindly leave this page.
Anyways, thanks for viewing my webpage. Expect
more soon!
